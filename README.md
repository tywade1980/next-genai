### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v20.19.5 or higher)
2. **npm** (10.8.2 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd next-genai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (optional):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

### AI Model Integration

#### OpenRouter Integration
This application supports OpenRouter API to access hundreds of AI models through a unified interface.

**Setup:**
1. Get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
3. Go to the AI Models page in the application
4. Click "Sync OpenRouter Models" to fetch available models
5. Configure and use OpenRouter models alongside OpenAI models

**Features:**
- Automatic model discovery and syncing
- Support for various model types (LLM, embedding, classification)
- Construction-specific capability inference
- Pricing and context length information
- Seamless fallback to mock responses when APIs are unavailable

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
